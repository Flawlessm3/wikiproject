## Overview

Welcome to **WikiDocs** — a fully modular documentation portal template. This site is a working, runnable example of the system architecture.

This template is designed for:

- **User guides** and how-to articles
- **API references** and technical specs
- **FAQ pages** and knowledge bases
- **Glossaries** and term dictionaries
- **CLI command references**

<Callout type="info">
  Everything you see on this page comes from the file `content/docs/getting-started/introduction.mdx`. Edit that file to change this content.
</Callout>

## Project Structure

The project is organized so that content and code are completely separated:

```
wiki-app/
├── content/docs/          ← Your MDX articles live here
│   ├── getting-started/
│   ├── guides/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── app/               ← Next.js routing
    ├── components/        ← UI modules (sidebar, toc, content, etc.)
    ├── config/
    │   └── navigation.ts  ← Sidebar structure (single source of truth)
    └── lib/
        └── docs.ts        ← Content loading utilities
```

## How to Add a New Page

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/docs/`:

```
content/docs/my-category/my-page.mdx
```

2. Add frontmatter at the top:

```mdx
---
title: My Page Title
description: Brief description of this page.
category: My Category
updatedAt: "2026-02-24"
---
```

3. Register it in `src/config/navigation.ts`:

```ts
{ title: 'My Page', slug: 'my-category/my-page' }
```

That's it — the page appears in the sidebar and gets prev/next links automatically.

## Design System

All visual tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are defined in `src/app/globals.css` as CSS custom properties. To change the color scheme, edit the `:root` block:

```css
:root {
  --accent: 99 102 241;   /* indigo — change this to rebrand */
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

The dark/light theme switch is handled by `next-themes` and stored in `localStorage`.
