## General

### What is WikiDocs?

WikiDocs is a fully modular, open-source documentation portal template built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It's designed to be:

- Easy to set up locally (one command)
- Easy to customize (design tokens, navigation config)
- Easy to extend (add pages by creating MDX files)

### Do I need a database?

No. All content is stored as plain `.mdx` files on the filesystem. No database, no CMS, no API keys required.

### Can I deploy this for free?

Yes. Since this is a statically generated Next.js site, you can deploy it for free on:

- **Vercel** (recommended — zero config)
- **Netlify**
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **GitHub Pages** (with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.mjs`)

## Customization

### How do I change the accent color?

Edit `src/app/globals.css`:

```css
:root {
  --accent: 236 72 153;  /* change to your RGB color */
}
```

### How do I change the font?

1. Import a new Google Font in `src/app/layout.tsx`
2. Set its `variable` to `'--font-sans'`
3. Done — the font applies everywhere automatically

### How do I add a logo image?

In `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`, replace the icon placeholder with:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

// Replace the <BookOpen> icon with:
<Image src="/logo.svg" alt="Logo" width={28} height={28} />
```

Place your logo in the `public/` folder.

### Can I disable the TOC?

Yes. In `src/app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx`, change:

```tsx
toc={toc.length > 0 ? <TOCPanel items={toc} /> : null}
// to:
toc={null}
```

Or remove the `<TOCPanel>` block entirely.

## Content

### How do I use Callout blocks?

Use the `<Callout>` component directly in your MDX:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  This action cannot be undone.
</Callout>
```

Available types: `info`, `tip`, `warning`, `danger`, `note`

### How do I add code examples?

Use fenced code blocks with a language identifier:

````mdx
```typescript
const greeting: string = 'Hello, world!'
console.log(greeting)
```
````

The language label appears in the code block header, with a copy button.

### How do I link between pages?

Use standard Markdown links with the full `/docs/` path:

```mdx
See the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide.
```

### How do I add images?

1. Place the image in `public/images/`
2. Reference it in MDX:

```mdx
![Alt text](/images/my-diagram.png)
```

For optimized images with Next.js `<Image>`, import it as a component in your MDX.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The page is blank / shows a 404

Check that:
1. The MDX file exists at the correct path in `content/docs/`
2. The slug in `navigation.ts` matches the file path exactly

### Styles are not applying

Run `npm run dev` again — sometimes Tailwind's JIT compiler needs a restart to pick up new class names.

### `Module not found` errors after adding a component

Make sure the import path uses `@/` (mapped to `src/`) and that the file extension is `.tsx`, not `.ts` (for React components).
