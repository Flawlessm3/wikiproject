## Content Organization

### Keep pages focused

Each page should cover one topic. If a page grows beyond ~1500 words, consider splitting it into sub-pages.

### Use consistent frontmatter

Set a standard template for all pages:

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: One sentence summary (used in metadata and search results).
category: Category Name
updatedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: Author Name
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

### Slug naming conventions

Use lowercase, hyphenated slugs that match the directory structure:

| Content path | URL |
|---|---|
| `content/docs/core-concepts/overview.mdx` | `/docs/core-concepts/overview` |
| `content/docs/faq/index.mdx` | `/docs/faq` |
| `content/docs/commands.mdx` | `/docs/commands` |

---

## Writing Style

### Start with the outcome

Begin each page by explaining **what the reader will be able to do** after reading it, not the background theory.

### Use headings generously

Good heading structure:
1. Helps readers scan the page
2. Generates a useful TOC automatically
3. Creates anchor links for deep linking

### Prefer short paragraphs

Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences. Dense walls of text are harder to scan.

---

## Using Callouts Effectively

| Callout type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `info` | Supplementary context, good-to-know facts |
| `tip` | Shortcuts, recommended approaches |
| `warning` | Things that might go wrong |
| `danger` | Irreversible or destructive operations |
| `note` | Technical caveats or edge cases |

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't overuse callouts. If every paragraph has one, they lose their visual emphasis.
</Callout>

---

## Maintenance

### Keep `updatedAt` current

Update the `updatedAt` frontmatter field whenever you revise a page. It's displayed to readers in the article metadata.

### Use `related` links

When articles are closely related, link them explicitly:

```mdx
---
related:
  - getting-started/installation
  - core-concepts/architecture
---
```

This populates the "Related Articles" section at the bottom of the page.

### Review disabled items regularly

Items marked `disabled: true` in `navigation.ts` are shown grayed out with a badge. Remove the `disabled` flag when the page is ready.

---

## Performance

<Callout type="info">
  All pages are statically generated at build time. Adding more pages does **not** slow down the runtime — only the build step gets longer.
</Callout>

### Keep images optimized

When adding images, use Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic optimization:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/your-image.png" alt="Description" width={800} height={400} />
```

Place images in the `public/` directory.
