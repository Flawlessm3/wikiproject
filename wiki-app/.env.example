# PostgreSQL connection — required only when running with a database.
# Locally you can skip this; the app uses data/wiki.json instead.
#
# Vercel Postgres (Neon): copy these from your Vercel project → Storage → KV → .env.local
# Any other PostgreSQL also works — just set the two URLs below.

# Pooled connection (used by Next.js serverless functions)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"

# Direct connection (used by Prisma migrations and seed)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME"
